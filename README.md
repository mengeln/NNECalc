## NNE Modeling Calculator

### Description

This project is for developing a standard tool for predicting Chlorophyll concentrations primarily from nitrogen and phosphorous levels. This includes processing queries from the SWAMP database, performing automated QA/QC, aggregating lab data for each field sample, running these data through several regression models, and outputting user friendly data tables and graphics.
